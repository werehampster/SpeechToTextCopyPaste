# SpeechToTextCopyPaste

The program contains one window on which there will be a textbox. This textbox will take a string from a speech to text program. 
The string in this textbox will be highlighted automatically so the screenreader program JAWS will read it out and the user can 
check it for mistakes. Pressing a yet to be determined key copies the string into the clipboard and automatically pastes it in a 
destination program such as Microsoft Word.
